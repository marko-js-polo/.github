## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Saulo](https://github.com/svallory), nice to have you here!
Please, make yourself at home.

This community was created to share tools, templates, and libraries that make working with [Marko](https://markojs.com)
even more enjoyable.

I've been around for a while and I've never seen a language/framework hold so much promise as Marko does. 
I got really excited by the possibilities so I started building a bunch of stuff to make creating new projects in Marko easier

I'm just starting to assemble everything here, so please be a little patient while I setup everything.

But, just so you know what is comming, here's an image of the site that's comming up. But don't mind reading the descriptions.
The projects are real (most of them are almost done) but the descriptions are mostly placeholders.
